This repository contains the code I used for my seminar thesis, which can be found in the `experiments` folder. The thesis and presentation that is a result of these code snippets can be found in the [seminar-thesis repository](https://github.com/stuckkk/seminar-thesis).

There are four sections in that folder. The first one contains mostly data explorations and visualizations while the second one contains all the precprocessing steps. The third folder contains the code for the actual trainig and the fourth folder was used to create the visualizations that were actually used in the seminar thesis.
